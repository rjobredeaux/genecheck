Installation instructions are in the INSTALL file.

In order to use:

- generate the C code for a controller using Gene-Auto+.
- run genecheck toto.c , where toto.c is the main C file generated.

Warning: the process takes time, and the output is somewhat long.
Each ACSL contract will be converted to a PVS theorem and automatically
verified. In the folder working_dir_pvs you will find the converted theorems,
as well as the proof file you can use to replay the proof in PVS.
The last line of output will give a summary of the proofs that were made 
successfully.
