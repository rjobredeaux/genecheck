INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

THESE INSTRUCTIONS NEED TO BE FOLLOWED IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY APPEAR.

(Optional tip: Why3 and Frama-C have quite a few dependencies. 
On Ubuntu >= Lucid Lynx 10.04, before running the install steps, you may run:
sudo apt-get install frama-c
This will *NOT* install the right version of frama-c, however it will
get most of the dependencies out the way. After that run
sudo apt-get remove frama-c
and proceed with the following instructions)
